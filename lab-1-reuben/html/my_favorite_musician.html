                <p>What I love about Kirk Hammett is his versatility in playing from the heavy sound of "Master of
                    Puppets"
                    to
                    the
                    slow, soft tone of "One." My favorite song by him and Metallica is "One,"
                    which I learned on guitar but adapted with a fingerstyle approach. My favorite album would have to
                    be
                    Death
                    Magnetic </p>

            <blockquote>My guitars are my umbilical cord. They're directly wired into my head</blockquote>
            <cite>--Kirk Hammett</cite>

            <br>

            <p>Kirk Lee Hammett (born November 18, 1962) is an American musician. Hammett has been the lead guitarist
                of heavy metal band Metallica since 1983; prior to joining Metallica, he co-formed thrash metal band
                Exodus in 1979. In 2023, Hammett and Metallica bandmate James Hetfield were co-ranked 23rd on Rolling
                Stone's list of Greatest Guitarists of All Time. In 2009, Hammett was ranked number 15 in Joel
                McIver's book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists</p>


            <h3>Musical Career</h3>

            <h4>Exodus (1979–1983)</h4>

            <p>
                Hammett's musical interests eventually drew him into the thrash metal genre. In 1979, he
                formed the band Exodus at sixteen, along with vocalist Paul Baloff, guitarist Tim
                Agnello, bassist Geoff Andrews, and drummer Tom Hunting. Hammett named Exodus after the Leon Uris novel
                of the same name, and played on the band's 1982 Demo also its successor Die By His Hand from
                1983. Exodus was an influential band. During the Exodus
                phase Hammett took lessons from Joe Satriani who was based in Berkeley, California at the time.<br>



            <h4>Metallica (1983–present)</h4>

            In 1983, Metallica traveled to the east coast to record its debut album, Kill 'Em All. Due to lead
            guitarist Dave Mustaine's substance abuse and violent tendencies, he was fired shortly after their
            arrival, and would eventually form the band Megadeth. Hammett received a phone call from Metallica
            on April 1, and flew out to New York for an audition on April 11, the same day Mustaine was let go.
            Vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield said: "The first song we played was "Seek and Destroy", and Kirk
            pulled off this solo, and it was like ... things are going to be alright!". Hammett was instantly asked
            to join the band</p>

            <h4>Interesting Info</h4>

            <p>On October 1, 2012, Abrams Image published Hammett's first book, Too Much Horror Business (a collection
                of photos detailing Hammett's lifelong love of monster movies and horror memorabilia). Hammett has
                said that the book is "basically" all of the horror memorabilia he has managed to amass over the last 30
                years</p>
