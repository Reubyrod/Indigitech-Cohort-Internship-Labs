                                    of all the races. From an initial
                                    examination of the fighting methods of the individual dwarf soldier, this volume
                                    expands its focus to look at how they
                                    do battle in small companies and vast armies. It covers all of their troop types

                                    lines of battle to their deadly accurate crossbowmen. Also examined are their
                                    tactics in specific situations such as
                                    underground fighting and combat in mountainous terrain. Finally, the book examines a

                                    detail in order to fully demonstrate the dwarven way of war.</p>

                                <p>A plague has ravaged the population of gold dwarves of the Great Rift. It starts
                                    slowly, but the progression is
                                    devastating. One dwarf has eyes that have become hard and glassy like marbles; a
                                    second dwarf has skin that flakes off
                                    in sharp, hardened scales; the skeleton of a third is petrified and fused in place;
                                    a fourth wastes away with blood that
                                    has turned dark and muddy.</p>
